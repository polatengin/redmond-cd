# `cd` command from scratch in C

This is a simple _C_ implementation that mimics the behavior of the `cd` (_change directory_) command found in _Unix-like systems_.

The program changes the _current working directory_ to a specified directory or to the _home_ directory if no argument is provided. It also supports switching to the _previous directory_ using the `-` option.
